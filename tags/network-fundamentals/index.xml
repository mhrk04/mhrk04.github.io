All computers that are connected to a network and participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts. Hosts can also be called end devices. Some hosts are also called clients. The term hosts specifically refers to devices on the network that are assigned a number for communication purposes. This number is called the Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address identifies the host and the network to which the host is attached.</description></item></channel></rss>
